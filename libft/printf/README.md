# printf

My attempt on recoding the infamous printf function from the standard libC.
It is a mandatory project of the 42 cursus.

I had to code :

      . cspdiuxX% conversions
   
      . precision, width (positive and negative) 


I tried implementing a few bonus of the subject, including :

      . hh, h, l and ll length modifiers
   
      . f and n conversions (be careful as f precision does not exceed 15 digits and n segfaults if a NULL pointer is given, for now).
   
      . + and space flags for signed conversion
   
   
I'll gladly accept any comment or founded criticism on my code. Feel free to do so.

Have a great day / night !
